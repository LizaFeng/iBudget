<!-- This will be where the user is able to see their previous budgets in PDF form 
 and see what their email and username is
 
 advanced features:
 - being able to change their password.
 - being able to delete their account 

 this would also be where we have the login/signup if we sense that the user did not signup

 the previous budgets (future: filter by the month and the year)
